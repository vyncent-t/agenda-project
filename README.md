This project is a work day task manager that dynamically keeps track of the current time and date, allowing the user to follow the priority of their tasks with the current time. 

To visually aid the user the planner has a color system:
The hours that are in the past will change the gray
The current hour will be a light green,
The future hours will be a darker green.

As the time passes through the 9am to 5pm work day, the user can update and save their tasks in the order of which they wish to complete them.
