NEED TO:

<!-- A. DISPLAY CURRENT DAY AS MAIN TITLE
    - Title content already exist, need to change the title content with updating moment.js tools -->

<!-- B. CREATE TIMEBLOCKS FOR 9-5 WORK DAY
    - Create grid layout with bootstrap for every hour that exists in the work day -->

<!-- C. COLOR TIMEBLOCKS FOR PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE
    - Exist in base CSS? -->

D. WHEN CLICKING ON A TIME BLOCK, CAN ENTER AN EVENT
    - Need to make it so you cannot add to a time that has passsed?
    - Use inputs for user input

E. SAVE BUTTON THAT STORES THE USER INPUT EVENT TO THE LOCAL STORAGE
    - Events must be static on refresh



Keep inputs static on page? not the "" function?

jQuery functions for when the time right now timeRN class is set to current 
- if time is less than time rn make gray
- if the time is not yet then blue


need inputs to be static
need to save inputs to local data
prevent default on forms
forms on every input? lables?

add buttons
